# Tomorrow-ify

For tomorrow, Spotify.

Giving you a playlist for tomorrow's listening pleasure.

## Local Development

### Website

To run the website locally, you can use the `Make` command `make run-website`. This will use node to host the website on a local server for you. You don't _have_ to host this way, but it makes life easier.

This requires you having `node` installed, and an `NPM` version of 5.2.0 or greater.
